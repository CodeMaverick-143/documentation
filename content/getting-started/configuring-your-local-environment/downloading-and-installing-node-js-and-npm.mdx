Downloading and Installing Node.js and npm
To publish and install packages to and from the public npm registry or a private npm registry, you need to install Node.js along with the npm command line interface. We highly recommend using a Node version manager like nvm for this purpose. Using a Node installer is not advised, as it can lead to permissions errors when running npm packages globally due to local installation directories.

Note: To download the latest version of npm, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
npm install -g npm

Installing Node.js and npm Using a Version Manager
Node version managers allow you to easily install and switch between multiple versions of Node.js and npm, which is essential for testing applications across different environments.

Recommended Node Version Managers
For macOS or Linux:

nvm
n
For Windows:

nodist
nvm-windows
Installing Node.js and npm Using an Installer
If using a Node version manager is not an option, you can install Node.js and npm using an installer.

Installers for macOS and Windows
For macOS and Windows users, download one of the installers from the Node.js download page. Always select the version labeled LTS (Long Term Support), as other versions may not be fully compatible with npm.

Installers for Linux and Other Operating Systems
For Linux and other operating systems, we recommend using the NodeSource installer. You may also use installers from the Node.js download page or refer to this package manager guide for Linux, which many developers prefer.
